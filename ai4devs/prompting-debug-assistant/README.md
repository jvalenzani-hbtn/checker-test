# AI-Powered API Prototyper

## **Introduction and Context**
APIs are the backbone of modern applications, but manually creating them requires extensive knowledge of frameworks, data structures, and best practices. AI tools can dramatically accelerate API development by generating endpoints, data models, and documentation based on natural language descriptions. This project teaches learners how to leverage AI for rapid API prototyping and validation.

## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this project, learners will be able to:

- Use AI to generate functional API endpoints from business requirements
- Create comprehensive data models and validation schemas with AI assistance
- Generate API documentation and testing suites automatically
- Validate and iterate on AI-generated APIs through testing and refinement
- Understand the strengths and limitations of AI in API development
